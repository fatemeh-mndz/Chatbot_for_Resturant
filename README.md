# 🍽️ Ayfa Restaurant — Persian Cuisine Chatbot Demo

Welcome to **Ayfa Restaurant**, a showcase project that simulates an online Persian restaurant experience, enhanced with a fully integrated Dialogflow chatbot assistant for handling customer interactions like:

- 🗓️ Table reservations  
- 📦 Order tracking  
- ❌ Order and reservation cancellation  
- ☎️ WhatsApp confirmations via Twilio

> ⚠️ This is not a real restaurant. This project is developed solely to demonstrate my skills in front-end development, chatbot integration, and API communication.
